# Asteroids
Asteroids Project for ECE 30862

Completed 2 years ago...only now uploading this code since this project is no longer assigned in this course, so plagerism is no longer a concern. Project is done in Java. Simply compile the code to play. 

Non-Functional Features:

  - 2 Player Mode (Player Two's ship does not have functional hit detection)
  - Continue Option (Game does not currently let you save and continue if you close the window)

Bugs

  - Scoreboard only works if you intialize the directory with a list of "dummy" scores
  - Rogue ship has unexpected behavior at higher levels, may not appear at all
  - Gravity point has been observed to immediately apply the maximum force to the ship rather than gradually increasing the force. Bug seems to happen when player is spamming keys after a death during the respawning animation.
